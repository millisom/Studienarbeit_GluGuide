## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this test plan is to define the testing strategy for the GluGuide project — a full-stack application using Node.js, Express, React, and PostgreSQL. It describes the objectives, scope, approach, and resources needed for the testing effort.

This test plan supports the following objectives:

- Define the scope of testing for frontend, backend, API, and end-to-end scenarios.
- Establish a process to verify the quality and reliability of application features.
- Outline tools and techniques used to test the application effectively.
- Identify risks and provide mitigation strategies.

### 1.2 Scope

This plan covers:

- Frontend testing: UI components, user interactions.
- Backend testing: Routes, middleware, services.
- API testing: REST endpoint validation.
- End-to-end testing: Full user journey workflows.

Out of scope:

- Load and performance testing.
- Mobile platform testing.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for:

- Developers
- Test engineers
- Project managers
- QA analysts
- Stakeholders interested in quality assurance

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

### 2.1 Background

GluGuide aims to help users track and manage their glucose levels with insights and intuitive UI. Given the sensitive nature of user data and the importance of health tracking, a strong testing strategy is essential to ensure usability, reliability, and data correctness.

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission

- Validate feature completeness and correctness.
- Ensure UI meets usability expectations.
- Verify backend and database logic.
- Simulate real-world user scenarios and edge cases.
- Catch regressions through automation.

### 2.3 Test Motivators

- Data integrity for glucose tracking.
- Secure user authentication and authorization.
- Correctness of API behavior.
- UI responsiveness and accessibility.

---

## 3. Target Test Items

- Frontend (React): Pages, forms, components.
- Backend (Express): Routes, controllers, services.
- Database (PostgreSQL): Schema validation, queries.
- APIs: RESTful endpoints.
- Full workflows: E2E flows (login, dashboard interaction, tracking submission).

---

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests

### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions

**Frontend:**

- Unit testing with Jest.
- Component testing with React Testing Library.

**Backend:**

- Unit testing with Jest (controllers/services).
- Integration testing for routes.

**API:**

- Postman scripts for endpoint validation.

**E2E:**

- Cucumber + Selenium for behavior-driven testing.

### 4.2 Outline of Candidates for Potential Inclusion

- Accessibility testing using tools like axe-core.
- Manual exploratory testing.

### 4.3 Outline of Test Exclusions

- Load/performance testing.
- Mobile/responsive testing.

---

## 5. Test Approach

### 5.1 Initial Test-Idea Catalogs

- Acceptance criteria in Gherkin syntax.
- Common failure points (login, DB write operations).

### 5.2 Testing Techniques and Types

- Unit Testing – Jest
- Component/UI Testing – React Testing Library
- End-to-End Testing – Cucumber + Selenium
- API Testing – Postman + Newman

---

## 6. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 6.1 Test Plan

#### Entry Criteria

- Feature complete (development done).
- Code pushed to `deploy` branch.

#### Exit Criteria

- All critical tests passed.
- Regression suite green.

### 6.2 Test Cycles

- Weekly regression cycle.
- Pre-release testing on `main`.

---

## 7. Deliverables

- Unit and integration test reports (Jest).
- E2E test logs (Cucumber).
- API test collections (Postman).
- Test coverage reports.
- Test summary documentation.

---

## 8. Testing Workflow

- Azure DevOps pipelines will:
  - Trigger on pull requests and merges to `deploy`.
  - Run Jest tests (frontend and backend).
  - Run Postman collection using Newman.
  - Deploy to production (on merge to `deploy`).
- Manual approval gates for production deployment: In Azure DevOps, you can set up approval gates to prevent a release from going into production without someone (usually a developer, QA lead, or product owner) manually reviewing and approving it.
- Cucumber + Selenium E2E tests triggered via pipeline or local execution.

## Appendix A: Code Quality Metrics

This appendix defines the two code quality metrics selected for use in the GluGuide project. These metrics will guide refactoring efforts aimed at improving code maintainability and quality.  
**Measurement Tool:** **SonarCloud** for **CC** (full-repo analyses, historical dashboards) and **Madge** for **Ce**

### A.1 Cyclomatic Complexity (CC)

- **Definition:**  
  Cyclomatic Complexity measures the number of linearly independent execution paths through a source-code module (function/method). Each `if`, loop (`for`/`while`), `switch` case, `catch` block, or logical operator (`&&`/`||`) that introduces a new branch increases the complexity by one.

- **Interpretation & Guidelines:**  
  - **1–5 (Low):** Simple, easy to understand, test, and maintain.  
  - **6–10 (Moderate):** Manageable, but with a few decision points.  
  - **11–20 (High):** Likely difficult to understand/test; consider refactoring.  
  - **>20 (Very High):** Strong candidate for immediate refactoring to simplify control flow.

- **Goal & Threshold:**  
  - **Flag:** Functions/methods with the highest CC value.  
  - **Refactoring target:** Reduce CC of 2 chosen files (one frontend, one backend) by at least 30% in the selected modules.

- **Measurement:**  
  - Reported automatically by SonarCloud through **sonarcloud.io**.
  - “Before” and “After” screenshot captured in Appendix B.

---

### A.2 Efferent Couplings (Ce)

- **Definition:**  
  Efferent Couplings count the number of *distinct* external modules (files/classes) that a given module depends on (e.g., via `import` or direct calls).

- **Interpretation & Guidelines:**  
  - **0–5 (Low):** Highly independent—easy to reuse and test.  
  - **6–10 (Moderate):** Acceptable for orchestrating modules.  
  - **>10 (High):** Too many dependencies—brittle to changes, hard to test in isolation.

- **Goal & Threshold:**  
  - **Flag:** Module with the highest Ce value.  
  - **Refactoring target:** Reduce Ce of two chosen modules (one frontend, one backend) by at least 25% through abstraction or responsibility reorganization.

- **Measurement:**  
  - Captured by Madge after running the following terminal commands:
    - `npx madge --summary gluGuideSetup/server`
    - `npx madge --summary gluGuideSetup/client/src`  
  - “Before” and “After” evidence stored in Appendix B.

## Appendix B: Metrics Report

- **B.1 Madge “Before” Analysis** (Ce)
  
  **Ce for server.js (17)**

  ![Ce before for the server.js](/Assets/BeforeServer.png)

  **Ce for App.jsx (26)**

- **B.2 Madge “After” Analysis** (Ce)
  
  **Ce for server.js (4)**

  ![Ce after for the server.js](/Assets/AfterServer.png)

  **Ce for App.jsx (2)**

  ![Ce after for the App.jsx](/Assets/AfterApp.png)

- **B.3 SonarCloud “Before and After” Analysis** (CC)

  **CC for postController.js went from 76 to 46**

  **CC for ViewBlogEntries.jsx went from 61 to 1**

  That gave us reduction of 90 which you can see below.
