![Alert Management CRUD Diagram](docs/UseCaseManageAlerts/UCManageAlerts.drawio.png)

### 2.1 Basic Flow  
In general, a user will open their dashboard, view all alerts, create a new alert, edit or delete an existing alert.

### 2.2 Creation  
The creation of a new alert requires the user to specify parameters such as time and frequency.

This was our Vision:

```gherkin
Feature: Create Alert
    As a logged-in user
    I want to create, edit, or delete alerts
    So that I can receive timely glucose reminders

  Scenario: Create a new reminder alert
    Given I am on the "Set Reminder Alerts" page
    When I select "Daily" from the "Reminder Frequency" dropdown
    And I enter a time for the reminder
    And I click the "Save Preferences" button
    Then I should see the new alert in the "Your Alerts" table
    And the alert should show the selected frequency and time

  Scenario: Cancel Create a new reminder alert
    Given I am on the "Set Reminder Alerts" page
    When I select "Daily" from the "Reminder Frequency" dropdown
    And I enter a time for the reminder
    And I leave the page
    Then I shouldnt see a the new alert in the "Your Alerts" table
```
### 2.3 Edit
During editing, the user can modify the content of the alert.

And this was our Vision:

```gherkin
Feature: Edit Alert
        As a logged in user
        I want to edit a selfwritten alert
        So that I can update an alert

    Scenario: Edit an existing reminder alert
        Given I am on the "Your Alerts" page
        When I click the "Edit" button for an existing alert
        Then I should see the "Delete", "Update", and "Cancel" buttons
        And I should be able to modify the "Reminder Frequency" and "Reminder Time"
        When I change the frequency or time
        And I click the "Update" button
        Then the alert should be updated in the "Your Alerts" table with the new values


    Scenario: Cancel editing a reminder alert
        Given I am on the "Your Alerts" page
        When I click the "Edit" button for an existing alert
        And I see the "Delete", "Update", and "Cancel" buttons
        And I modify the frequency or time
        When I click the "Cancel" button
        Then the alert should remain unchanged

```
###  2.4 List

We want to implement a table below the alert mask that displays all alerts of the logged-in user. There is no user interaction required to view them. That means there is no need for a "List Alert Diagram" here.

```gherkin
Feature: List Alerts
        As a logged in user
        I want to list all alerts
        So that I can keep an overview of my reminders

    Scenario: List Alerts
        Given I am on the "Your Alerts" page
        And I scroll past the "Setting an alert" Container
        Then I see all of my alerts
```




###  2.4 Delete

The User can delete an alert.

        And I click the "Delete" button
